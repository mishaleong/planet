Hi misha
having fun with git hub!!!

when are we going to talk about branches?

I want to learn about branches!

here are the codes on how to do this:
#cd out of my current directory
cd ../
#make a new folder
mkdir michelle
#cd into the folder
cd michelle/
#clone into misha or my collaborator’s repository
git clone git@github.com:mishaleong/planet.git
#make a file
touch heylady.txt
#add the file
git add heylady.txt
#commit the file
git commit -m "hanging with misha"	
#push changes to misha’s computer
git push origin master	
# to make a change to the file
open heylady.txt
#write stuff
#then add it
git add heylady.txt
#then comit the changes
git commit –m “talking to misha”
#push these changes to misha’s repository
git push origin master
